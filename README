This is an extension of the Slidy presentation template (http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/help.html) that was originally created by Dave Raggett (dsr@w3.org). It enables to design a
presentation in HTML markup.

Enhancements
############

 * configurable metadata area on the top right side with (meta identifiers in brackets):
   - short title of the presentation (short_title)
   - author name (author_name)
   - presentation type (presentation type) - to be able to express the kind of a presentation, e.g., thesis defense
   
 * configurable navigation menu near the bottom:
   - can divide the presentation into up to 5 parts
   - the titles of the parts can be set via meta identifiers (frag_1 - frag_5)
   - single slides can be annotated with a specific part identifier via a class name (s_frag_1 - s_frag_5)
   - this toolbar can be toggled via the key 'M'
   
 * tabulator simulation:
   - tabulator can be simulated with the help of the classes 'tab' and 'normal' or restrictive 'tab2' and 'normal2'
   
 * restart page:
   - an URL of a restart page can be defined via the meta identifier 'restart_page'
